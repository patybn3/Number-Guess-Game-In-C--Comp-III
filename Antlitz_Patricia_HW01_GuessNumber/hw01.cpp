 Purpose: This is a guessing game developed in C++. The purpose of this game is to allow the player to guess numbers. The player will pick two numbers between 1-1000 as a range for the guess game. The user will also be prompt to enter the amount of rounds desired for the game. The program will then randomly select a number in this range so the user can make a guess. It will then give the player hints until the rounds are over or the player guesses the correct number.
 
 Sources of Help: I did now use any sources for this, but I have developed a similar game in java which can be found at
 https://github.com/patybn3/Guess_What_Number_JAVA/blob/main/GuessWhatNumber_PatriciaAntlitz.java
 
 *Problems encountered with be available in the README documentation
 
 Time Spent: Around 6 hours
