Guess What Number Game.

This program generates a guessing game in which the player will guess which secret number was selected by the program.

Technology used:
C++

Source used:
No external source used, but a similar project was previously developed by me using Java.
The project can be found at: https://github.com/patybn3/Guess_What_Number_JAVA
I did not use the code as a source though.

Requirements and User Stories:

- The player should be able to enter a minimum and a maximum number to use as a range. The minimum number must be equal or greater than 1, and less than 1000.
- The player should be able to select how many rounds the game will have, as long as it is less or equal to 10 rounds.
- The program should validate the inputs are within the correct ranges.
- This number should not be allowed to be changed once the game starts.
- The program should generate a random number within the minimum and maximum ranges, which will be used as the number to be guessed.
- The player should be able to guess the amount of times selected for the rounds.
- The game should give the player hints; if the secret number is greater or lower than the guesses number.
- If the player is not able to guess the correct number, the program should print what the number was.
- if the player guesses correctly, the game will congratulate the player.
- The player should be offered to play again.

Features added by me (not required):

- The program will also have a minimum rounds the player is allowed to play (2).
- The maximum number for the range will be less or EQUAL to 1000.
- The program forces the player to select at least 12 numbers as the range.
- The program will print a "menu" with instructions.
- Validates if guessed number is within the given range
- Accumulates scores. Player X Computer.
- Picks the winner.
- Uses pass-by-reference to update values
- I kept as much code as I could in separate methods (I don't like busy main functions')
- the program will take a round number, and the minimum and maximum numbers (all three number) BEFORE it checks if the entries are valid. This is not a bug.

Inputs/Intakes:

- You can assume that only integers will be entered through the keyboard.
(this means that this program is not checking for entries that are not a number. Pressing other keys on the keyboard will break the program.)

Pseudo Code:

//declare libraries
//use namespace for std
//declare function prototypes at the top of the program
//will initially need the following variables: minimum number, maximum number, random number, number of rounds.
//create a method to get the number of rounds
//check if the number entered is in between 2 and 10
//if not, let the user know they must enter a number between 2-10
//let the user select a minimum number and maximum number as a range according to the requirements
//ask the user to enter at least 12 numbers in the range
//if not, let the user know they need to pick enough numbers
//make program select a random number within the selected range
//once the game starts, check if the number guessed is within the range given
//if the number matches, the user gains a point
//store the point in a variable to increase it
//allow the user to guess "round number" of times.
//if the user is out of guesses and the number does not match, the computer gets a point
//give the player a hint every time a guess is incorrect, letting them know if the number is higher or lower than the number guessed
//allow the player to play again

Methods:

main() -> contains the following variables:
    roundNum, minNum, maxNum, playerScore, computerScore, all initiated as 0
    calls the following methods:
    printMenu()
    generateDate(uses all mentioned variables as arguments for its parameters)
    
printMenu() -> outputs instructions

generateData(int &playerScore, int &computerScore, int &roundNum, int &minNum, int &maxNum) -> gets user's entries, generates a random number, calls the function that starts the game (playGame(...)). 
    Parameters:
    playerScore -> only used to be passed to playGame(...)
    computerScore -> only used to be passed to playGame(...)
    roundNum -> gets the value from the user.
    minNum -> gets the value from the user.
    maxNum -> gets the value from the user.
    randomNum -> generates a random number.
    calls
    setRoundsNum(roundNum)
    getRangeNums(minNum, maxNum)
    playGame(uses all mentioned variables as arguments for its parameters)
    
setRoundsNum(...) -> gets the number entered by the user from generateData(...) and uses to validate the entry

getRangeNums(...) -> gets the numbers entered by the user for the range, uses it to validate entries

playGame(int randomNumber, int &roundNum, int &minNum, int &maxNum, int &playerScore, int &computerScore) ->
get the user's entries to play the game

playAgain(...) -> allows the user to play the game again


Test the code:
- entered less than 2 or more than 10 for round to get an error and be prompted to enter again
- entered less than 1 or more than 1000 to get an error and be prompted to enter again
- entered a number outside of the selected range as a guess to get an error and be prompted to enter again
- pressed different numbers to continue the game (besides 0 and 1)
